Required Environment- WAMP (Windows) or MAMP (MacOS)- MySQL Workbench tool- MySQL Database created     Set up - Download source dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/new-york-city-police-crime-data-historic- Make sure your MySQL Server is running, whether that be through WAMP or MAMP- Open up nyc_crimes.sql query file. Change the load data statement to use the data path leading to the folder containing the downloaded dataset. - Update allowed query time in your MySQL Workbench settings:o (on MacOS) MySQLWorkbench > Preferences > SQL Editor       		 set DBMS connection keep-alive interval (in seconds): 600        		 set DBMS connection timeout interval (in seconds): 60- (on Windows): MySQLWorkbench > Edit > Preferences > SQL Editor      		set DBMS connection keep-alive interval (in seconds): 600       		set DBMS connection timeout interval (in seconds): 60- Run the nyc_crimes.sql query file	Note that because of the size of the data, the runtime will take around 10 minutes. It is important to change your query time settings as explained above.- After you have run the sql file, place the frontend folder inside the wamp64/mamp folder’s www directory (for Windows) or the MAMP folder’s htdocs directory (for MAC) to have access to the frontend through your web browser.  - Edit the conn.php file with the details for your database login. - Finally, access the frontend at:	http://localhost/<frontend_folder>/index.html (for Windows) 	http://localhost:8888/<frontend folder>/index.html (for MAC)
